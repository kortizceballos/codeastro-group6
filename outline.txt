        Initializer - 
            populates name with command line inputs
            populates coordinate frame with command line inputs
            create class level custom simbad object with desired VOTable fields for results
            query simbad and get results table
            parse results table, populate coordinates and object type


        Name Resolver - 
            use new name to query simbad and get results table

Other Methods - 

    FITS retriever - 
        take as input target object, survey, fov
        construct query parameter dictionary
        encode hips2fits url
        query hips2fits and store FITS file

        
    Grid Builder - 
        take as input the target object
        set list of default surveys (e.g. X = ['2MASS', 'SDSS', etc...])
        set-up the figure and axes
        for each survey in X:
            run FITS retriever to obtain FITS file
            plot FITS file data on a subplot
            label axes with coordinates from FITS header
            set subplot title from survey name
        plt.show() the final figure


    Follow up plotter - 
        take as input a selected survey
        determine target object from stored variable
        set-up the figure and axes
        run FITS retriever with selected survey to obtain FITS file
        plot the hdu data
        label axes with coordinates from FITS header
        set plot title from survey name
        plt.savefig() as a pdf
        plt.show()
